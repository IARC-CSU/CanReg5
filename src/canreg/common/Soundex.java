/**
 * Soundex - the Soundex Algorithm, as described by Knuth
 * <p>
 * This class implements the soundex algorithm as described by Donald
 * Knuth in Volume 3 of <I>The Art of Computer Programming</I>.  The
 * algorithm is intended to hash words (in particular surnames) into
 * a small space using a simple model which approximates the sound of
 * the word when spoken by an English speaker.  Each word is reduced
 * to a four character string, the first character being an upper case
 * letter and the remaining three being digits. Double letters are
 * collapsed to a single digit.
 *
 * <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
 * Knuth's examples of various names and the soundex codes they map
 * to are:
 * <b>Euler, Ellery -> E460
 * <b>Gauss, Ghosh -> G200
 * <b>Hilbert, Heilbronn -> H416
 * <b>Knuth, Kant -> K530
 * <b>Lloyd, Ladd -> L300
 * <b>Lukasiewicz, Lissajous -> L222
 *
 * <h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
 * As the soundex algorithm was originally used a <B>long</B> time ago
 * in the United States of America, it uses only the English alphabet
 * and pronunciation.
 * <p>
 * As it is mapping a large space (arbitrary length strings) onto a
 * small space (single letter plus 3 digits) no inference can be made
 * about the similarity of two strings which end up with the same
 * soundex code.  For example, both "Hilbert" and "Heilbronn" end up
 * with a soundex code of "H416".
 * <p>
 * The soundex() method is static, as it maintains no per-instance
 * state; this means you never need to instantiate this class.
 *
 * @author Perl implementation by Mike Stok (<stok@cybercom.net>) from
 * the description given by Knuth.  Ian Phillips (<ian@pipex.net>) and
 * Rich Pinder (<rpinder@hsc.usc.edu>) supplied ideas and spotted
 * mistakes.
