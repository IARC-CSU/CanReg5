Here is an example from Kampala Cancer Registry report: 2007-2009.

Reports of cancer in Uganda date back to end of 19th century, when the first missionary doctor established western medicine in Uganda by constructing Mengo Hospital in Kampala. Davies et al. (1964) reviewed the hospital records of Mengo Hospital from 1897 to 1956. Kampala Cancer Registry (KCR) was established in 1954, in the Department of Pathology of Makerere University Medical School. The aim was to obtain information on cancer occurrence in the population of Kyadondo County, in which the capital city of Kampala is situated. The registry functioned continuously both before and after independence (1962), until the military coup of General Idi Amin Dada in 1971. Thereafter, full population coverage was not possible, although a register was maintained within the Department of Pathology until 1980, when all registration ceased. With the
return of political stability, the registry restarted in 1989 and has functioned continuously since. Initially, the registry used request/result forms of the department of pathology, redesigned specifically to permit registration of cancers. Thus, they contained demographic information on the patient, as well as the source of the specimen and the results of the examination. In addition to data collected in this way, tumour registrars have been employed to search for cancer cases admitted to, or treated in, the four main hospitals in Kampala (and, in recent years, the Uganda Hospice) and, for individuals resident in Kyadondo County, to extract somewhat more extensive information onto special notification forms.

Between 1954 and 1980, registration was manual, apart from the period 1964-1968, when the data were transferred to punched cards (Templeton, 1973), which are no longer available in Uganda. The details of all patients were entered into a large register. Since 1989 the registration process has been computerized, using the CanReg system of IARC. Results of the registry have been published in volumes 1, 7, 8 and 9 of "Cancer Incidence in Five Continents" (Doll et al, 1966; Parkin et al, 1997, 2002; Curado et al 2007)

KCR is situated in the Department of Pathology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Makerere University College of Health Sciences. It is managed by a part-time Director (pathologist), the Cancer Registrar and an Assistant Cancer Registrar.
