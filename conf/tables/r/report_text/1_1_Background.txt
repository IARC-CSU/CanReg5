Here is an example from Kampala Cancer Registry report: 2007-2009.

Reports of cancer in Uganda date back to end of 19th century, when the first missionary doctor
established western medicine in Uganda by constructing Mengo Hospital in Kampala. Davies et al.
(1964) reviewed the hospital records of Mengo Hospital from 1897 to 1956. Kampala Cancer
Registry (KCR) was established in 1954, in the Department of Pathology of Makerere University
Medical School. The aim was to obtain information on cancer occurrence in the population of
Kyadondo County, in which the capital city of Kampala is situated. The registry functioned
continuously both before and after independence (1962), until the military coup of General Idi
Amin Dada in 1971. Thereafter, full population coverage was not possible, although a register was
maintained within the Department of Pathology until 1980, when all registration ceased. With the
return of political stability, the registry restarted in 1989 and has functioned continuously since.
Initially, the registry used request/result forms of the department of pathology, redesigned
specifically to permit registration of cancers. Thus, they contained demographic information on
the patient, as well as the source of the specimen and the results of the examination. In addition
to data collected in this way, tumour registrars have been employed to search for cancer cases
admitted to, or treated in, the four main hospitals in Kampala (and, in recent years, the Uganda
Hospice) and, for individuals resident in Kyadondo County, to extract somewhat more extensive
information onto special notification forms.

Between 1954 and 1980, registration was manual, apart from the period 1964-1968, when the
data were transferred to punched cards (Templeton, 1973), which are no longer available in
Uganda. The details of all patients were entered into a large register. Since 1989 the registration
process has been computerized, using the CanReg system of IARC. Results of the registry have
been published in volumes 1, 7, 8 and 9 of "Cancer Incidence in Five Continents" (Doll et al, 1966;
Parkin et al, 1997, 2002; Curado et al 2007)

KCR is situated in the Department of Pathology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Makerere
University College of Health Sciences. It is managed by a part-time Director (pathologist), the
Cancer Registrar and an Assistant Cancer Registrar.
