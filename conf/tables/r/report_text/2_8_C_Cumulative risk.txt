Cumulative incidence is the probability or risk of individuals developing the disease during a specified period. For cancer, it is expressed as the number of new born children (out of 100, or 1000) who would be expected to develop a particular cancer before the age of 75 years ( or 65 or 70), if they had the age-specific incidence rates of cancer observed in the defined period, in the absence of competing causes. As a measure of direct standardization, it permits comparisons between populations of different age structures, though it has some advantages over the ASR; it avoids the use of an (arbitrary) standard population, and, as the measure is readily interpretable, it is easier to communicate to general audiences.
