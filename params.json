{"name":"CanReg5","tagline":"a multi user, multi platform, open source tool to input, store, check and analyse cancer registry data.","body":"### Description\r\nCancer registries need a tool to input, store, check and analyse their data. If these data are also coded and verified in a standard way, it facilitates the production of comparable analyses across registry populations. The main goal of the CanReg5 project is to provide a flexible and easy to use tool to accomplish these objectives. CanReg5 is a multi user, multi platform, open source tool to input, store, check and analyse cancer registry data. It has modules to do: data entry, quality control, consistency checks and basic analysis of the data  It was designed with an emphasis on user friendliness, it has a modern user interface and is easy to navigate.  Is available in several languages. (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Georgian, and Chinese.)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMorten Johannes Ervik (@IARC-CSU / @mortenjohs)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with CanReg?
